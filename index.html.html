    <p style="color: rgb(0, 251, 255); font-size: 20px;">A supercar also called exotic car is a loosely defined
        description of street-legal, high-performance sports cars. Since the 2000s or 2010s, the term hypercar has come
        into use for the highest performing supercars. Supercars commonly serve as the flagship model within a vehicle
        manufacturer's line-up of sports cars and typically feature various performance-related technology derived from
        motorsports.</p>

    <img src="vintage car.jpg" width="375" height="250">
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 251, 255); font-size: 20px;">A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile,
        and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. Such
        enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage
        cars, classic cars, and so on.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #ff0095; font-size: large;">Difference between Sports cars and supercars </h2>
    <p style="color: rgb(0, 251, 255); font-size: 20px;">Supercars are essentially a high-performance luxury type of
        sports car. This means their design includes premium car parts, they have more power and more advanced
        technology. Whilst still classified as 'street legal', supercars are rarer and harder to handle than sports
        cars.</p>
